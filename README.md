# Challenge - Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)

## Computer Vision meets Facial Expressions.

In this challenge it's all about detecting emotions in human faces (images). 

The data consists of 100x100 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

The task was to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of five categories (Angry, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise). The training set consisted of 9,108 examples and the test set consisted of 2,388 examples.
